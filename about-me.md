title: About me
---

I am a Brit left happily stranded in Helsinki, but yet to become fully Finn-fluent at ice skating. I am the same height as footballer Lionel Messi, but I have several more years' playing experience.

I take a UX-first approach to building web apps, taking inspiration from apps like [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io) and [Trello](https://trello.com), and paying close attention to the research-based [UX findings from NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/). I'm also a strong believer in progressive enhancement, and like building user interfaces that are based on a strong foundation of HTML and CSS, with JavaScript layered in on top.

The technologies I use include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/index.html), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/). I am currently getting into Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and I'm excited at the possibilities opening up before me as I dive deeper into them.

I take inspiration from many people in my industry. Their influence on me stretches far beyond the technical side of web development into communication, UX, business, project management, productivity and politics. Here are some of them:

[David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk/), [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me/), [Andr√© Staltz](https://staltz.com/), [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/), [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/), [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/), [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/), [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/), [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/), [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/about/) and [Jeffrey Way](https://laracasts.com/).

Within the local development community here in Helsinki, here are some of the people who have helped me personally in my career, both through good advice and by helping create a vibrant local community for developers: [James Stone](http://www.jamesstone.com/), [Juhis](https://hamatti.org/), [James Elderfield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elderfd/) and [An Cao](https://ancaois.me/). Big shout out to all of them!
