## My professional side

I take a UX-first approach to building web apps, taking inspiration from apps like [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io) and [Trello](https://trello.com), and reading [UX tips from NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/). I'm also a strong believer in progressive enhancement, and like building user interfaces with a strong and accessible foundation of HTML and CSS.

I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/index.html), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/). I am currently learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and loving what I've seen so far.

Like any self-respecting developer, I have opinions and preferences which are (hopefully) my own. To give you a brief flavour of my thinking, here are some main influences: [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk/), [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me/), [Andr√© Staltz](https://staltz.com/), [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/), [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/), [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/), [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/), [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/), [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) and [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/about/).

Within the local development community here in Helsinki, I'd like to give a shout out to these community leaders, former team mates and general good eggs: [James Stone](http://www.jamesstone.com/), [Juhis](https://hamatti.org/), [James Elderfield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elderfd/) and [An Cao](https://ancaois.me/).

## My personal side

A Brit left happily stranded in Helsinki, I am yet to become fully Finn-fluent at ice skating. I am the same height as footballer Lionel Messi, but I have several more years' playing experience.

My interests outside programming include [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF2UlLKoBR8), [football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IicmCu47pMo), [freestyle football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9RufAmD3gQ), [chess](https://lichess.org/), [Tolkien](https://youtu.be/nkCZAPw81qs?t=55), [J. K. Rowling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8xs-hxsFHg), [Paul Auster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4I0h0kNH4M), [Woody Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmnLRVWgnXU), [Noam Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjENnyQupow), and the [climate justice movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=visMsTZHNDo).
